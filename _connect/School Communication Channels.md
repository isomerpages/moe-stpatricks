### **School Communication Channels**

Throughout the year, parents will be updated on key school events via the Parents Gateway (PG). Please refer to this [link](/files/Step%20by%20Step%20Guide%20to%20Setting%20Up%20Parent%20Gateway.pdf) for the step-by-step guide to the setting up of the PG app.

Keep in touch with the rich array of Patrician events and achievements by following us on our social media platforms, [Facebook-St Patrick's School Singapore](https://www.facebook.com/stpatricksschl.singapore/) and [Instagram-@stpatricksschoolsg](https://www.instagram.com/Stpatricksschoolsg/). You can also explore our website at [https://stpatricks.moe.edu.sg/](https://staging.dgqb0jbouderh.amplifyapp.com/).

From time to time, the school may be using your child’s and your photographs, images or video footage on the school’s official communication channels (e.g. social media platforms, website, yearbook and others) or for briefings, workshops and other educational purposes. Photographs, videos and / or sound recordings of students will not be used in publicity campaigns placed with external media outlets unless parental consent is given.

If you would like to withdraw consent with respect to the collection, use or disclosure of the above data, you can do so by writing in to the school via the school’s email address, [stpatricksch@moe.edu.sg](mailto:stpatricksch@moe.edu.sg).
