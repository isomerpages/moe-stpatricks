<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to the St. Patrick’s School community! As the Co-Chairperson
of the Parent Support Group (PSG), it is my privilege to invite you to
join us on this meaningful journey of nurturing and shaping the lives of
our sons.</p>
<p>At St. Patrick’s, we believe that a strong partnership between parents
and the school is key to fostering a positive and enriching environment
for our boys to grow, learn, and thrive. The St Pat’s PSG is a vibrant
community of dedicated parents who actively collaborate with the school
to enhance the teaching and learning experience for every Patrician.</p>
<p>The PSG serves as a platform for parents to connect, share, and support
one another in this exciting but often challenging parenting journey. Together,
we aim to embody a mindset of “Doing With” and “Enabling Positive Growth,”
supporting not only our boys but also each other. Through our activities,
we provide opportunities for parents to get involved in meaningful ways—whether
it is by volunteering during school events, organising workshops for fellow
parents, or participating in programmes that support the social and emotional
development of our boys.</p>
<p>Beyond these activities, the PSG also values the power of prayer and community.
Together, we uplift one another and our sons, drawing strength from our
faith and dedication to their well-being.</p>
<p>We warmly invite you to join us as partners in nurturing confident, compassionate,
and capable young men. Let’s work hand in hand to make their journey at
St. Patrick’s truly memorable and impactful.</p>
<p>With warm regards,
<br>Leonie Nagarajan
<br>Co-Chairperson
<br>The Patrician Parents - Parent Support Group (PSG)</p>
