_Warm wishes for good health and peace be with you!_

Established in 1933 by the Brothers of the Christian Schools who arrived from Ireland, St Patrick’s School is a Lasallian institution with an illustrious tradition of Touching Hearts, Engaging Minds and Transforming Lives.

<br><br>

Applying a proactive, positive approach to student wellbeing and holistic development, St Patrick’s School provides a contemporary educational experience that enables one and all, to flourish. We believe that an ability-driven, values-based education which fosters inclusiveness and promotes achievement, will prepare our students to lead a life of service and distinction.

Take your time to browse through our website and get a glimpse of the rich experiences we offer for young gentlemen. The pictures and anecdotes will serve to illuminate our commitment to grow more cohesive as a COMMUNITY, live in FAITH and SERVE with Love. Indeed, POTEST QUI VULT! (He Who Wills, Can!)

May God bless us, keep us safe and bring forth success in all endeavours!
