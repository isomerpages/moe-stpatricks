<h4><strong>Peace be with you and welcome to St Patrick’s School!</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Boys of Faith, Gentleman with Purpose and Leaders with Heart, who are worthy of God and man.</strong> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words were on my mind as I walked through the school gates for the
first time as Principal. They stem from a rich Lasallian tradition and
the calling of our founder St John Baptist de La Salle to transform young
lives through education. Since its founding in 1933, St Patrick’s School
has done just that, creating generations of Patricians who have gone on
to make a positive impact in their communities and in Singapore. I thank
my predecessor, Mr Mark Minjoot, and the school leaders who have come before
us for stewarding the school over the past 92 years. I am honoured to take
up the baton in the next stage of the school’s journey.</p>
<p>As a Catholic-mission school, St Patrick’s provides students with a holistic
student-centric curriculum which focuses on character development and values.
We adopt <strong>Boy Centric Education (BCE) Principles</strong> and understand
how boys grow, develop and mature. This guides how we craft our curricular
programmes, from lessons to enrichment activities, from learning journeys
to CCAs. We provide structures and routines that develop in our Patricians
positive habits, and strong values. We design authentic and relevant learning
experiences, including our Love-in-Action Programme which develops Patricians
to contribute meaningfully to society. Students gain <strong>empathy for others, leadership skills and the ability to work well as a team</strong>.
We recognise every Patrician as a unique individual. Premised on how every
student can be a creator, our Passion Pursuits &amp; Achievers Programme
allows students to explore and reflect on a variety of interest areas,
and pursue their passions at a deeper level. At St Patrick’s, <strong>every boy will be known, valued, and can flourish</strong>.</p>
<p>In a world that is increasingly complex and dynamic, our youth need to
develop <strong>critical, adaptive and inventive thinking</strong>, and
the ability to connect and transfer what they know to new contexts. As
a new member of the school community, two programmes stood out to me in
equipping our students with these attributes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Our STEM Applied Learning Programme allows Patricians to experience different
fields in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It is a valuable
platform for them to acquire knowledge and skills, discover strengths and
interests, and explore possibilities for further education and careers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;In our Learning for Life Programme in Music &amp; Music Technology,
Patricians experience the arts as both audience and participant through
our music curriculum, developing a deeper appreciation of the arts in future.
The infusion of technology tools to create music allows students to witness
first-hand how different disciplines can intersect to unlock new possibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just two of the many ways St Patrick’s develops our students
to access new and emerging interdisciplinary fields in the future of work
and shine brightly in the future economy.</p>
<p>A school cannot be a school without its people. I am in awe of my colleagues
and partners: our teaching staff, student support team, school support
team, De La Salle Brothers, parents and alumni who work tirelessly and
give selflessly to create a caring environment. Together, we have a strong
village which nurtures the boys who enter our gates, that they may leave
as gentlemen and leaders. I invite you to join us in our mission to <strong>touch hearts, engage minds, and transform lives</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Potest Qui Vult!</strong></h4>
