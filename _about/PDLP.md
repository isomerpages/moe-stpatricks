<h4><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme</strong></h4>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD).</p>
<p>The aims of PDLP is to …</p>

<p>St Patrick’s School has selected Chromebooks as its PLD. Despite its small
size, our Chromebook of choice will be lightweight, durable, with touchscreen,
camera and stylus.&nbsp; Bundled with 3 years of warranty and insurance
coverage, it offers superb value for money and will provide students with
many good years of learning and productivity.</p>
<p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform –
the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)– as well as other educational
technology to personalize and enhance students’ learning. This will also
enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they
navigate an increasingly digitalised world.</p>
<h4><strong>Use of Edusave</strong></h4>
<p>If your child/ward is a Singapore citizen, you can use your child’s/ward’s
Edusave to pay partly or fully for the PLD. A Singapore citizen student
can use up to the available Edusave balance in his Edusave account to pay
for the PLD after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous
fees.</p>
<h4><strong>Financial Assistance</strong></h4>
<p>Subsidies are available to students who require financial assistance.
Singapore Citizens who are already on MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)
or School-based FAS will automatically qualify for these subsidies and
do not need to take any action.&nbsp; Please note that it is compulsory
for all existing students on MOE FAS to use their Edusave to pay for the
PLD, after subsidies have been granted.</p>
<p>Students who are currently not under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme
may approach the school’s General Office to apply for additional subsidy
if their Gross Household Income (GHI) is $4,000 or less, or Per Capita
Income (PCI) is $1,000 or less.</p>
<p>“<strong>PCI</strong>" refers to the Gross Household Income divided by
the total number of family members in the household.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students from eligible low-income households may apply for the DigitalAccess@Home
scheme by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which provides
subsidised broadband access. More information can be found at: <a href="https://imda.gov.sg/dah" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://imda.gov.sg/dah</a>
</p>
<h4><strong>ICT applications</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the programme, the school will make available ICT applications
that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; &nbsp;Student iCON: Every student will be given an email address.
This is a service provided by Google as part of Google Suite.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft Pro Plus: Every student will be able to use
Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.</p>
<p>The schools may also choose to roll out applications other than those
listed above. The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s personal
data such as his name and class to set up user accounts. Please refer to
our Frequently Asked Questions section for more information on the collection
of data via these applications.</p>
<h4><strong>Cyber-wellness</strong></h4>
<p>In rolling out the PLD, MOE is acutely aware of concerns regarding students’
cyber-wellness. The DMA allows the school to manage this, by</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; collecting data on usage by the student, such as the
amount of time spent on each application,</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; &nbsp; monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites
accessible to the student, and</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp; &nbsp; placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order
to prevent cyber addiction.</p>
<p>Please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions section for more information
on the DMA as well as MOE’s collection of data.</p>
