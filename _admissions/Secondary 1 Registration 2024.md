# Secondary 1 Registration


The Secondary 1 Registration for 2024 at St. Patrick’s School will be conducted **online**. An **_Information Booklet_** will be sent via Parents Gateway (PG) **by 5pm on the day of the release of posting results**. The **_Information Booklet_** will include details on the purchase of uniforms and books. We seek your cooperation to read through the **_Information Booklet_** thoroughly and **refrain from coming down to the school without a prior appointment**. More information on the booking of appointment slots can also be found in the **_Information Booklet_**.


If you do not have a PG account, please download the **Parents Gateway App** on the _Apple App Store_ or the _GooglePlay Store_ and sign up for an account with your SingPass **before** posting results are released. The school will also be using PG as a primary mode of communication for future announcements. Please refer to the guide below for setting up your PG account if you have not done so.

**Sec 1 Orientation Programme**

The 5-day Orientation Programme from **2 to 8 January 2024**, aims to help our new Patricians familiarise themselves to the school environment and to help them develop skills to begin managing this transition. Through activities such as a Heritage Tour, Mass Dance and Inter-Orientation Group (OG) Competition, we hope our Patricians will develop a sense of belonging to the school.

The students will be assigned to **Orientation Groups** for the programme and **this can be viewed on PG when you receive the _Information Booklet_.** A detailed schedule of the orientation can also be found in this booklet.

**Appeals for Transfer into St. Patrick’s School**

For those who wish to appeal for transfer into St. Patrick’s School, please submit [**this form**](https://form.gov.sg/652377b7074ea80012e2cbb0) by **22 December 2023, 5 pm.**&nbsp;

Schools will only be allowed to admit a student on discretionary basis if he has met the COP of the school for that year's S1 Posting. This is to ensure that discretionary admissions are aligned with S1 Posting, where posting is based on academic merit as demonstrated through the PSLE. Students seeking admission solely on the basis of other talents and achievements should only be admitted through DSA-Sec.

Students successfully allocated to their DSA schools will not allowed to transfer to another school. They are expected to honour their commitment to the allocated DSA school for the entire duration of the programme.

If the applicant is from an affiliated primary school, he will need to meet the affiliate COP if they had indicated the affiliated secondary school as his first choice during the School Choice Submission period. Otherwise, the applicant will need to meet the non-affiliate COP.

Please refer to the following for the COP for Affiliated and Non-Affiliated students.
