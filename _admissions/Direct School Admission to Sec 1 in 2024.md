#### **Direct School Admission – Secondary (DSA-Sec)**

The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by MOE to provide students who possess diverse range of achievements and talents to seek admission into secondary schools before the release of their PSLE results. &nbsp;There is no priority through affiliation and all students seeking admission will be selected based on the students’ achievements and talents in comparison to all applicants in the same category.

**Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.**

**Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.**

Boys who are interested in pursuing their talents and passion in St Patrick’s School are encouraged to apply for DSA through the following domains:
