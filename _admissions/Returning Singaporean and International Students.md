### **Returning Singaporean and International Students**

#### **School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans – Secondary (SPERS-Sec)**

Singaporean students (Singapore citizens and Singapore Permanent residents) returning from overseas or currently studying abroad are advised to contact the Ministry of Education directly to participate in the School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans – Secondary (SPERS-Sec). SPERS-Sec is a centralised posting exercise conducted at around September or October each year for returning Singaporeans who wish to join secondary schools at Secondary 1, Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 at the beginning of the next academic year. For more information, please refer to the [MOE website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans/secondary/spers/results).

#### **International Student Admissions**

International students who wish to seek admission to mainstream schools are required to sit for and pass the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS) administered by the Ministry of Education. Admission is not guaranteed, and is subject to the applicant’s performance in the centralised test and available school vacancies. Successful applicants will not be allowed to choose their school, and requests for school transfers will not be entertained.
