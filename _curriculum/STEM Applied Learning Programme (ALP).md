This was a student-initiated workshop to share knowledge with their peers on creating a first -person perspective game using Unity® software. At the end of the workshop, students created their own games embedded with elements to promote awareness on issues such as being socially responsible during the pandemic.

##### **Computational Thinking Interest Group**
This interest group is an initiative involving students with passion and aptitude in pursuing computational thinking. Various platforms are provided for them to apply their knowledge about technology, with some of these technologies benefitting other students and even public community at large.

A group of students from this interest group took part in the DrCT 2021, which is a computational thinking challenge where students solve tasks reviewed by the National Olympiad of Informatics (NOI). They performed well and received the following accolade: 1 Gold, 2 Silver, 4 Bronze and 3 Honourable Mentions. Some of these students went on to participate in the NOI.
