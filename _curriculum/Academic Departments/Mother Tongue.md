#### **Department's core beliefs**
St Patrick’s School Mother Tongue Department envisions  helping Patricians seek out the joys of learning their Mother Tongue, uncover the beauty of their culture, and to develop them to be active communicators and keen appreciators of their own culture.

#### **About Department**
Student-centric based structure, learning-processes and resources are our main focuses in developing Patricians’ aptitude in their Mother Tongue.    

Students who display flair in the language are regularly given opportunities to develop their potential via enrichment classes and exposure to external competitions. 

Likewise, students who require additional support are provided with customized learning resources, focused learning strategies and a collaborative learning environment to help them enjoy the learning process. 

In addition, activities such as the Mother Tongue Language Fortnight experience, learning camps and cultural festival-based activities are carefully curated and provide a culturally rich learning experience for our students.
