#### **Department Highlights**

The English Language and Literature department is dedicated to ensuring our students are able to read widely, think critically and communicate effectively in all mediums. Our multi-faceted approach towards language learning focuses on student choice, digital literacy and authentic learning. As a department, we are passionate in nurturing all Patricians to appreciate the value of the written and spoken word.

##### **SPS Reads!**
In Lower Secondary, we nurture the habit of extensive reading in our students. Patricians go through a library orientation where they are also introduced to different genres in order to expand their reading tastes. We also guide our students in the use of National Library Board’s (NLB) Libby app, so students can read on the go!
