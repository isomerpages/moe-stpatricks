#### **Department Highlights**

The English Language and Literature department is dedicated to ensuring our students are able to read widely, think critically and communicate effectively in all mediums. Our multi-faceted approach towards language learning focuses on student choice, digital literacy and authentic learning. As a department, we are passionate in nurturing all Patricians to appreciate the value of the written and spoken word.

##### **SPS Reads!**
In Lower Secondary, we nurture the habit of extensive reading in our students. Patricians go through a library orientation where they are also introduced to different genres in order to expand their reading tastes. We also guide our students in the use of National Library Board’s (NLB) Libby app, so students can read on the go!

In Upper Secondary, our programme aims to encourage students to remain well-versed in Current Affairs. Regular teacher-led and peer-led sharing in class as well as Current Affairs quizzes spark our students’ interest in reading more widely about events that are affecting the world around us.

##### **SPS Speaks!**
Patricians go through a structured programme that aims to develop them into confident and eloquent speakers. In Lower Secondary, they immerse themselves in story-telling and giving speeches. In Upper Secondary, the department focuses not just on preparing students for the national oral exam but also for the interviews many of them go through as they apply for post-secondary institutions.

##### **Theatre Visits**
An understanding of drama and stage performance is integral to students' understanding of the world around them. As such, the department makes available theatre experiences to students across all levels in concert with their learning. In the COVID-19 period, we have made good use of the affordances of technology to continue to expose students to theatre in a safe manner, and will continue to explore other beneficial opportunities. The department also conscientiously uses these chances to teach students audience and theatre etiquette - important skills for the refined Patrician gentlemen they eventually grow into!

##### **Competitions and other External Events**
Talented students in both English and Literature are regularly given stretch opportunities to further develop themselves at key points in the semester. Amongst many others, we have sent students to participate in the Rice Media Dialogic Competition, the Queens Commonwealth Essay Writing Competition and the YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards. We also participate in the annual National Schools Literature Festival and the Inter-School Poetry Appreciation Seminar.
