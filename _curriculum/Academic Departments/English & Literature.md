<h4><strong>Department Highlights</strong></h4>
<p>The English Language and Literature department is dedicated to ensuring
our students are able to read widely, think critically and communicate
effectively in all mediums. Our multi-faceted approach towards language
learning focuses on student choice, digital literacy and authentic learning.
As a department, we are passionate in nurturing all Patricians to appreciate
the value of the written and spoken word.</p>

<h4><strong>SPS Reads!</strong></h4>
<p>At St. Patrick's School, we have an innovative approach to fostering a
love for reading among our students. We have relocated the library to the
heart of our learning environment—right inside the classrooms! Every class
now features its own library, curated with a diverse selection of genres
to cater to varied reading preferences. To further promote reading as a
daily habit, we have introduced a weekly reading session each morning before
assembly. This initiative ensures that our students start their day with
the enriching experience of exploring new stories, ideas, and perspectives.
At SPS, we believe that reading is the key to opening doors to endless
knowledge and creativity.</p>

<h4><strong>Theatre Visits</strong></h4>
<p>An understanding of drama and stage performance is integral to students'
understanding of the world around them. As such, the department makes available
theatre experiences to students across all levels in concert with their
learning. In the COVID-19 period, we have made good use of the affordances
of technology to continue to expose students to theatre in a safe manner,
and will continue to explore other beneficial opportunities. The department
also conscientiously uses these chances to teach students audience and
theatre etiquette - important skills for the refined Patrician gentlemen
they eventually grow into!</p>

<h4><strong>SPS Talent Development Programme</strong></h4>
<p>At St. Patrick's School, we are committed to cultivating the talents of
our higher-ability students, providing them with opportunities to extend
their proficiencies through authentic experiences and prestigious competitions.
This approach serves not only as a platform for skill enhancement but also
as a form of affirmation, recognising and celebrating their strengths.
Our Talent Development framework is carefully curated to suit the strengths
of our students, particularly in the areas of speaking and writing. These
programmes are strategically designed to accommodate manpower availability
while ensuring that students across all levels benefit from such opportunities.</p>
