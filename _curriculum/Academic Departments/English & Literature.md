<h4><strong>Department Highlights</strong></h4>
<p>The English Language and Literature department is dedicated to ensuring
our students are able to read widely, think critically and communicate
effectively in all mediums. Our multi-faceted approach towards language
learning focuses on student choice, digital literacy and authentic learning.
As a department, we are passionate in nurturing all Patricians to appreciate
the value of the written and spoken word.</p>

<h5><strong>SPS Reads!</strong></h5>
<p>In Lower Secondary, we nurture the habit of extensive reading in our students.
Patricians go through a library orientation where they are also introduced
to different genres in order to expand their reading tastes. We also guide
our students in the use of National Library Board’s (NLB) Libby app, so
students can read on the go!</p>
<p>In Upper Secondary, our programme aims to encourage students to remain
well-versed in Current Affairs. Regular teacher-led and peer-led sharing
in class as well as Current Affairs quizzes spark our students’ interest
in reading more widely about events that are affecting the world around
us.</p>

<h5><strong>SPS Speaks!</strong></h5>
<p>Patricians go through a structured programme that aims to develop them
into confident and eloquent speakers. In Lower Secondary, they immerse
themselves in story-telling and giving speeches. In Upper Secondary, the
department focuses not just on preparing students for the national oral
exam but also for the interviews many of them go through as they apply
for post-secondary institutions.</p>
<h5><strong>Theatre Visits</strong></h5>
<p>An understanding of drama and stage performance is integral to students'
understanding of the world around them. As such, the department makes available
theatre experiences to students across all levels in concert with their
learning. In the COVID-19 period, we have made good use of the affordances
of technology to continue to expose students to theatre in a safe manner,
and will continue to explore other beneficial opportunities. The department
also conscientiously uses these chances to teach students audience and
theatre etiquette - important skills for the refined Patrician gentlemen
they eventually grow into!</p>
<h5><strong>Competitions and other External Events</strong></h5>
<p>Talented students in both English and Literature are regularly given stretch
opportunities to further develop themselves at key points in the semester.
Amongst many others, we have sent students to participate in the Rice Media
Dialogic Competition, the Queens Commonwealth Essay Writing Competition
and the YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards. We also participate in the
annual National Schools Literature Festival and the Inter-School Poetry
Appreciation Seminar.</p>
