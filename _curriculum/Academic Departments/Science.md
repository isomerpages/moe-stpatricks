#### About Department

The department aims to create an engaging and conducive learning environment that develops students into 21st century learners who are scientifically literate. 

Through our differentiated approach, we hope to nurture students who
*   enjoy learning Science and regard Science as relevant and meaningful 
*   have a strong foundation in Science and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry 
*   apply and experience the potential of Science to generate creative solution to solve real-world problems 

Technology and hands-on experiences are leveraged to 
*   engage and harness students’ preconceptions for conceptual change 
*   provide students with task environments that represent and simulate the real-world problems, situations, and contexts 
*   design tasks to connect, challenge, deepen and extend students’ thinking.
