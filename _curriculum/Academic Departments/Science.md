<h4>NXplorers 2.0</h4>
<p>NXplorers 2.0 Journey is championed by Science Centre Singapore and Shell
Singapore. It is a platform for young people to develop sustainable solutions
to food, water and energy challenges. Through the process, students learn
systems thinking, scenario planning, and develop change management skills
- all highly relevant skill sets that inspire and equip students to be
positive agents of change.</p>

<h4>VJC Amazing Eco-STEM Race 2024</h4>
<p>The 2024 VJC Amazing eco-STEM Race is a competition held during VJC Science
&amp; Technology Centre’s STEM Festival. It aims to engage secondary school
students by getting them to put their STEM knowledge and analytical skills
to the test in this race against time. They will also be scored based on
the accuracy of which they complete the tasks assigned. The challenge also
serves to start getting students to think about how the Science they learn
in the classrooms can be applied to tackling the most pressing issues of
today, primarily, the sustainability of the environment.</p>
