#### **Department Highlights**

The Science Department aims to enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate. We hope to provide a strong foundation in scientific innovation that will inspire students to pursue STEM for future learning.  

  

Inquiry continues to be a key experience in Science education. The department encourages our students to use scientific inquiry in coming up with innovative solutions for their everyday lives. To do this, as many students are possible are given platforms to apply their scientific knowledge in authentic settings.
