#### **Department's core beliefs**

Building a positive learning culture to develop students into competent and confident 21st century learners 

Use of technology to support students in understanding scientific ideas and organizing knowledge

Leveraging on real-world problems for conceptual change in a student-centric classroom

#### About Department

The department aims to create an engaging and conducive learning environment that develops students into 21st century learners who are scientifically literate. 

Through our differentiated approach, we hope to nurture students who
*   enjoy learning Science and regard Science as relevant and meaningful 
*   have a strong foundation in Science and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry 
*   apply and experience the potential of Science to generate creative solution to solve real-world problems 

Technology and hands-on experiences are leveraged to 
*   engage and harness students’ preconceptions for conceptual change 
*   provide students with task environments that represent and simulate the real-world problems, situations, and contexts 
*   design tasks to connect, challenge, deepen and extend students’ thinking.

##### 2. **Mindfest**  

Mindfest is organised by the Singapore Science Centre. Our Secondary Two Normal (Academic) students experience a day of putting technology and science together in applications related to their daily lives. This encourages the exploration of science, arts and technology through creative, immersive and enjoyable tinkering activities. It also helps students to understand the fundamentals of energy and its importance.

##### 3.  **Bright Ideas Challenge**

This prestigious inter-school competition challenged students to imagine how cities will look like in 2050, identify key energy challenges in the future and articulate their visions by presenting innovative solutions that would help make future cities a vibrant, healthy and clean place to live in.

In 2017, the team from St Patrick’s School won second place for their idea of layering roads and floors with piezo material as a means of renewable energy, by converting the pressure generated from road transport into electrical energy that can be used for lighting up the lampposts on the streets at night.

In 2018, the team from St Patrick’s School emerged third for their idea to design a 3-in-1 sustainable HDB building using renewable resources (water, sunlight and wind) to generate enough energy and clean drinking water for the household.

##### 4. **International C.B. Paul Science Quiz**  

The International C.B. Paul Science Quiz aims to provide a platform for students to develop their aptitude and potential in the pure and applied Sciences through critical thinking. There are 2 categories for the Quiz, the Lower Secondary and the Upper Secondary category. 

The school sends students for this Quiz annually. They performed well, receiving the following accolades over the years:
  

*   2017: 1 Gold and 4 Bronze awards
*   2018: 1 Gold, 1 Silver and 5 Merit awards
*   2019: 1 Bronze, 3 Honourable Mentions and 3 Merit awards
*   2021: 2 Gold, 6 Bronze, 6 Honourable Mentions and 5 Merit awards

##### 5. **MOE ExCEL Fest 2017**  

Our project for the Shell STEM Youth Innovation Challenge 2015, ‘NightDryer: A Solar-Heated Novel Alternative to Conventional Clothes Dryer’, which was one of the 4 top winners, was showcased during ExCEL Fest 2017. The SPS team comprised of students from all streams who journeyed together for seven months, applying their academic knowledge to eventually create the ‘NightDryer’ prototype. The experience not only sparked their interest in STEM but also enhanced their self-confidence and self-esteem. The students acquired skills in project management, problem solving and presentation.

During the ExCEL Fest, our school displayed the prototype, which is a system to harvest solar energy for households to dry clothes at night. For two days, our student representatives were able to engage our guests who included the Minister of Education and the Parliamentary Secretary of Education. They shared their project and how they have benefited from the experience.
