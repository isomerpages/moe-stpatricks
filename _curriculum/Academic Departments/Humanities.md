#### **Department Highlights**
The Humanities Education in St. Patrick’s School hopes to develop Patricians into informed, concerned and participative citizens. We also hope that our students will become responsible citizens who are equipped with skills to deal with societal issues through our programme. The Humanities Investigations (HI, GI & II respectively) continue to be our focal programme where authentic learning and joy of learning can take place. The investigations provide platforms for our students to be empowered, be good team players and also to apply 21st century skills and competencies.

_“The arts and humanities define who we are as a people. That is their power – to remind us of what we each have to offer, and what we all have in common. To help us understand our history and imagine our future. To give us hope in the moments of struggle and to bring us together when nothing else will.”<br> – Michelle Obama_
		 
#### **Department Events and Achievements**

##### **Learning Journeys and fieldwork studies**
Learning journeys and fieldwork studies help our students to extend their learning outside the classrooms. One of the focus for History unit is the Inquiry-based learning whereby students visit the National Museum and Fort Factory to complete their group projects. Students developed historical empathy as they put on the lenses of the various perspectives of the historical figures at that time through interacting with artefacts and sources.

The Secondary Three Geography students, on the other hand, visit Chinatown to apply what they have learnt about tourism in their Geography classes as well as to have a first-hand experience in data collection processes to facilitate their Geographical Investigation on tourism in Singapore. In addition, students in the Pure Geography class also have the opportunity to extent their learning about coastal processes through carrying out fieldwork at East Coast Beach.

For our students to develop a global outlook and to expand their humanities perspectives, the department also endeavor to provide opportunities for Overseas Learning Journey trip. In 2019, 20 Humanities students had the privilege to visit Japan to work on an Inquiry-based project that integrated the components of History, Geography and Social Studies.

##### **E-pedagogy and boy-centric education**
The Humanities curriculum is enhanced with the use of e-pedagogical affordances which allow students to learn in a more engaging and experiential way. In addition, as part of the whole school approach, the Humanities department embraces boy-centric teaching and it forms an integral part of the Humanities lesson design in order to cater to the learning needs of our students. Students immensely enjoy learning through competitive games, quizzes and collaborative platforms which are conducted synchronous and asynchronously.

##### **Competitions**
Our talented Humanities students are provided with competitive platforms for them to stretch their potential.

In 2019, we were proud champions for the ‘Time Capsule’ competition organized by Nan Hua High School. This competition challenges the students’ current affairs knowledge as well as their ability to think on their feet to solve global issues.

On top of this, the St. Patrick’s School Humanities students also actively participate in another similar competition called the ‘Humanities Challenge’ and ‘History Challenge’ organized by CHIJ Katong Convent and Bendemeer Secondary School respectively.  We clinched the top three positions in three consecutive years; 2017, 2018 and 2019 for the ‘Humanities Challenge’.
