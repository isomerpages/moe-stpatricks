<p><strong>Art</strong> at Lower Secondary offers students the opportunity
to explore 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional art forms through a range of
teaching approaches. These include guiding them through appreciating well-known
artworks, using digital apps for stop-motion animation videos, basic photography
and exploring dry and wet media such as acrylic and color pencil rendering.
Students are also provided the opportunity to understand and learn art
and design principles. These principles are then used in the completion
of authentic art tasks. Students are also guided through a reflection process
to improve on the quality of their submissions.</p>
