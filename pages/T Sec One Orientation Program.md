<h2><strong><u>Secondary 1 Orientation Programme</u></strong></h2>
<p>The 4-day Orientation Programme on&nbsp;<strong>2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 10th January 2025</strong>,
aims to help our new Patricians familiarize themselves to the school environment
and to help them develop skills to begin managing this transition. Through
activities such as a Heritage Tour, Mass Dance and Inter-Orientation Group
(OG) Competition, we hope our Patricians will develop a sense of belonging
to the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The students will be assigned to&nbsp;<strong>Orientation Groups</strong>&nbsp;for
the programme and&nbsp;<strong>this can be viewed on PG</strong>.&nbsp;A
detailed schedule of the orientation can also be found in this booklet.</p>
