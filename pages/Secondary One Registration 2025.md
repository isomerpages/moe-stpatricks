<h4><strong>Appealing for Transfer due to Serious Medical Conditions</strong></h4>
<p>To request for transfer out of our school due to serious medical conditions
or severe physical impairments, please do so in person at our General Office
by <strong>12:00 pm, 19 December 2024, Thursday.</strong>
</p>
<p>All appeals must be accompanied by relevant supporting documents, such
as medical reports and letters from doctors. For information on appealing
for a transfer due to serious medical conditions, please go to this <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting/results/appeal-for-school-transfer/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE website</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Appealing for Transfer due to Non-Medical Reasons</strong></h4>
<p>Schools will only be allowed to admit a student on discretionary basis
if he has met the COP of the school for that year’s S1 Posting. This is
to ensure that discretionary admissions are aligned with S1 Posting, where
posting is based on academic merit as demonstrated through the PSLE. Students
seeking admission solely based on other talents and achievements should
only be admitted through DSA-Sec.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students successfully allocated to their DSA schools will not be allowed
to transfer to another school. They are expected to honour their commitment
to the allocated DSA school for the entire duration of the programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the applicant is from an affiliated primary school, he will need to
meet the affiliate COP if they had indicated the affiliated secondary school
as his first choice during the School Choice Submission period. Otherwise,
the applicant will need to meet the non-affiliate COP.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please refer to the following for the COP for Affiliated and Non-Affiliated
students.</p>
