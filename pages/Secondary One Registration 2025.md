<h3><strong><u>Secondary 1 Orientation Programme</u></strong></h3>
<p>The 4-day Orientation Programme on&nbsp;<strong>2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 10th January 2025</strong>,
aims to help our new Patricians familiarize themselves to the school environment
and to help them develop skills to begin managing this transition. Through
activities such as a Heritage Tour, Mass Dance and Inter-Orientation Group
(OG) Competition, we hope our Patricians will develop a sense of belonging
to the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The students will be assigned to&nbsp;<strong>Orientation Groups</strong>&nbsp;for
the programme and&nbsp;<strong>this can be viewed on PG</strong>.&nbsp;A
detailed schedule of the orientation can also be found in this booklet.</p>

<p>Schools will only be allowed to admit a student on discretionary basis
if he has met the COP of the school for that year’s S1 Posting. This is
to ensure that discretionary admissions are aligned with S1 Posting, where
posting is based on academic merit as demonstrated through the PSLE. Students
seeking admission solely on the basis of other talents and achievements
should only be admitted through DSA-Sec.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students successfully allocated to their DSA schools will not allowed
to transfer to another school. They are expected to honour their commitment
to the allocated DSA school for the entire duration of the programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the applicant is from an affiliated primary school, he will need to
meet the affiliate COP if they had indicated the affiliated secondary school
as his first choice during the School Choice Submission period. Otherwise,
the applicant will need to meet the non-affiliate COP.</p>
