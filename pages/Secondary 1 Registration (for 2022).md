More information on the booking of appointment slots can be found in the **Information Booklet**.

##### **Sec 1 Orientation Programme**

The 5-day Orientation Programme from 4-7 & 10th January aims to help our new Patricians familiarise themselves to the school environment and to help them develop skills to begin managing this transition. Through activities such as a Heritage Tour, Mass Dance and Inter-Class Competitions we hope our Patricians will develop a sense of belonging to the school.

The students will be assigned to **orientation groups** for the programme and **this can be viewed on PG when you receive the Information Booklet**. A detailed schedule of the orientation can also be found in this booklet.

#### **Appeals for Transfer into St. Patrick’s School**

Appeal for transfer into St. Patrick’s School will be open on the day of the release of posting results. Please submit this [form](https://form.gov.sg/619c96c5c40357001294eab3)**broken link** by **27th December 2021, 5pm.**

Schools will only be allowed to admit a student on discretionary basis if he has met the cut-off-point (COP) of the school for that year's S1 Posting. This is to ensure that discretionary admissions are aligned with S1 Posting, where posting is based on academic merit as demonstrated through the PSLE. Students seeking admission solely on the basis of other talents and achievements should only be admitted through DSA-Sec.

Students successfully allocated to their DSA schools will not allowed to transfer to another school. They are expected to honour their commitment to the allocated DSA school for the entire duration of the programme.

If the applicant is from an affiliated primary school, he will need to meet the affiliate COP if they had indicated the affiliated secondary school as his first choice during the School Choice Submission period. Otherwise, the applicant will need to meet the non-affiliate COP.

Please refer to the following for the COP for Affiliated and Non-Affiliated students.
