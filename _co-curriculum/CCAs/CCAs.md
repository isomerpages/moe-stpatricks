### **CCA Framework**

St Patrick’s School aims to provide a vibrant and robust co-curriculum programme in the holistic development of our students. Our CCAs are platforms for our students to develop talent, build character and develop leaders. CCAs also help to facilitate the development of values and lifeskills in each child. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, we provide an environment for our students to pursue their interests as far as possible. We believe that students tend to flourish in areas there are interested in. Our robust and holistic CCA curriculum helps students discover as well as develop their strengths and talents grounded in our school’s values.

Our CCAs offer varied experiences to cater for our students’ interest and their holistic development in their journey in St Patrick’s School.
