### **Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Cohort Learning Experiences**

ECG in St Patrick’s School highlights the importance of self-responsibility, as students make informed decisions in working towards their goals. In line with the national Skills Future movement, the department continues to engage students in the area of Education and Career Guidance (ECG) through lessons and learning journeys.

**Secondary 1 students** first discover more about themselves, their individual interests through self-evaluation tools and a visit to the Lifelong Learning Institute (LLI).
