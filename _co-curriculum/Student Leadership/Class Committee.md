### **Class Committee**

Tier One of our leadership education focuses on Self Leadership, where we nurture every Patrician to become “Boys of Faith, Gentlemen with Purpose and Leaders with Heart” through opportunities where they would be equipped with leadership skills and knowledge. The Class Committee provides multiple platforms for every Patrician to positively transform their class culture and environment to one where they feel a sense of belonging towards.
