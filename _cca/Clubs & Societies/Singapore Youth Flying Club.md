<h4><strong>CCA Profile</strong></h4>
<p>The SPS Youth Flying Club was founded in 2024. With a shared passion for
aviation, students from diverse backgrounds and interests, united in our
exploration of aeromodelling and the skies, come together to learn more
about flying and the skies.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, students pick up skills such as constructing and
piloting aeromodelling designs like unpowered launch gliders and RC line
controls.</p>
<p>The partnership between the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and
SYFC has launched flight experience programs that enabled members to feel
the excitement of flying on RSAF aircraft, including the MRTT (Multi Role
Tanker Transport) A330. These experiences offered valuable chances to engage
with local pilots, share stories, and gain insights into the aviation industry.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>A highlight of this year was the “Aero Challenge 2024 and SYFC Inter-School
Aeromodelling Competition,” hosted by Aero Dynamics, Singapore Polytechnic,
and SYFC. Our members honed their skills in building unpowered launch gliders,
working collaboratively to construct and launch them. The competitions
showcased exceptional teamwork and enthusiasm among students, embodying
the spirit of our club. As a result of our hard work and dedication, SPS
Youth Flying Club proudly secured top positions in the Unpowered Glider
category, thanks to the outstanding performance of our pioneering team
of boys.</p>
