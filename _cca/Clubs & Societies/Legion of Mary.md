<h4><strong>Profile</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>"Who is she that comes forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army set in battle array"</strong></h5>
<p>The Legion of Mary is a Catholic CCA in school, which focuses on the spiritual
group and development of all Catholic students. Members meet up on a weekly
basis for prayer and spiritual formation, taking inspiration and guidance
from Mother Mary, as our role model to bring Christ to everyone around
us.</p>
<p>The Legion of Mary in St. Patrickâ€™s School is compulsory for all Sec 1
Catholic students to attend and participate in, so as to grow in brotherhood
and ethos of the larger Catholic community in Singapore. We also assist
in school Masses and conduct the Daily Chapel Morning Prayer. We also work
with other Legion of Mary groups in other schools and churches in Singapore
to host events such as the Annual General Reunion and the Acies - renewal
of the Legion vows.</p>
