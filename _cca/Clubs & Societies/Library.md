##### **"Building a school library of the future!"**

Our library is not only a treasure trove of information, it serves as a community hub to support collaborative efforts and provide a conducive environment for staff and students to work in. Our student librarians are **passionate reading ambassadors** who help to maintain and manage the library space.

Student librarians partake in various training programmes by Civica. These programmes allow them to visit different subject matters such as the protection of urban biodiversity, local food sustainability initiatives and even how to apply hashtag searching across social media. They engage in meaningful discussions and present their findings to review and share their knowledge of the topics.
