As a relatively new CCA, SPS Modern Dance aims to instill a love for dance in its students by exposing them to the intricacies of movement and hidden complexities of music.

Our regular training sessions include a healthy mix of physical conditioning to shore up the dancersâ€™ strength and execution of their moves, as well as exposure to new dance vocabulary to improve their versatility as practitioners.

Despite the challenges that COVID-19 has thrown our way, the resilient spirit of the CCA shines through and each batch of students emerges hardier than ever.
