### **Modern Dance**

#### **Profile**

##### **"Dance is the joy of movement and the heart of life"**

As a relatively new CCA, SPS Modern Dance aims to instill a love for dance in its students by exposing them to the intricacies of movement and hidden complexities of music.

Our regular training sessions include a healthy mix of physical conditioning to shore up the dancers’ strength and execution of their moves, as well as exposure to new dance vocabulary to improve their versatility as practitioners.

Despite the challenges that COVID-19 has thrown our way, the resilient spirit of the CCA shines through and each batch of students emerges hardier than ever.
