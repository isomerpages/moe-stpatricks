SPS Modern Dance aims to instill increased body and spatial awareness in our members whilst providing a safe, fun and enriching environment for them to develop bonds that will last them a lifetime. During our regular CCA training we go through some physical conditioning followed by the learning of a simple choreography either for internal or external showcases. We also look forward to annual mainstay activities such as learning journeys, team bonding games and overnight camps.
