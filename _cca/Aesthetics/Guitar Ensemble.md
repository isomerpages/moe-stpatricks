#### **Profile**

##### **"Excellence through Preparation!"**

Undaunted by the challenges posed by the pandemic, our budding guitarists have continued to create meaningful experiences in the CCA. Leveraging on ICT, our members maintained strong connections by hosting key events such as our Secondary 4 Farewell Ceremony and team bonding days, online via Zoom. Over the past 2 years, the ensemble continued to overcome restrictions preventing a physical concert by performing and broadcasting their performance to the public through livestream on Facebook.

Our young guitarists continue to embody perseverance in pushing through considerable challenges to accomplish present victories. Under the expert guidance of our conductor Mr. Ow Leong San, the ensemble has augmented its sound quality and music-making experience. As our ensemble members continue to sharpen their skills, and strive to deliver enjoyable performances to the audience, we are convinced that the future holds much promise of excellence.&nbsp; Potest Qui Vult!
