<h4><strong>Profile</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>"Excellence through Preparation!"</strong></h5>
<p>Undaunted by the challenges posed by the pandemic, our budding guitarists
have continued to create meaningful experiences in the CCA. Leveraging
on ICT, our members maintained strong connections by hosting key events
such as our Secondary 4 Farewell Ceremony and team bonding days, online
via Zoom. Over the past 2 years, the ensemble continued to overcome restrictions
preventing a physical concert by performing and broadcasting their performance
to the public through livestream on Facebook.</p>
<p>Our young guitarists continue to embody perseverance in pushing through
considerable challenges to accomplish present victories. Under the expert
guidance of our conductor Mr. Ow Leong San, the ensemble has augmented
its sound quality and music-making experience. As our ensemble members
continue to sharpen their skills, and strive to deliver enjoyable performances
to the audience, we are convinced that the future holds much promise of
excellence.&nbsp; Potest Qui Vult!</p>
