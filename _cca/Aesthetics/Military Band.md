#### **Profile**

##### **“To develop strong musicians and leaders who will serve others”**

Set up on 2nd March 1953 as a bugle, fife and drum band, It became Singapore's first school military band in 1957 and evolved into a concert band in the mid-1980s. Over the years, the Saint Patrick’s School Military Band has established itself as one of the most outstanding secondary school bands in Singapore. With the sustained records of achievements over the years, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has recognized and awarded Saint Patrick’s School Military Band as **a Niche Programme School** in 2007. In the recent Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2021 Arts Presentation, Saint Patrick’s School Military Band continued to maintain the **standard of excellence** and added on to our **16 consecutive distinctions**; a feat achieved through our Patricians’ hard work and passion for music.

**Limelight 2019**<br>
Limelight is a concert series where some of the best school choirs and bands in Singapore are invited to perform at the Esplanade Concert Hall. The SPS Military band had the privilege of being a part of this concert series and the response to our performance was tremendous, with more than 1,100 people in attendance. We presented a diverse repertoire of different genres of music, consisting of Don't Stop Me Now, a popular pop song by Queen, an instrumental jazz fusion composition, Spain, St. Elmo's Fire and many more.

**Junior Band Festival 2019**<br>
The Junior Band Festival is an event held yearly by Brillante music to showcase the musical growth of the Secondary 1 band members in their first year. Students from different schools come together to interact and perform in front of each other. Most of them have never experienced performing in front of a large audience so it can be quite daunting. The festival gives new members an opportunity to perform and experience the atmosphere. This is to prepare them for what will come over the next few years in the band. Last year, the festival was held in the Salvation Army Theatre and we performed three pieces, Band Picnic and Spanish Rose by Joseph Compello, and That’s What I Like, arranged by Michael Story. The Junior Band Festival was a great milestone and a perfect way to kick-start our members’ journey.
