#### **Profile**

##### **"Above all!"**

Our school’s NCC Air exhibited excellence in multifarious aspects to clinch the Distinction Award in this year’s Unit Recognition. On top of rigorous training that increased our cadet’s fitness, our cadets also collaborated with the Singapore Kindness Movement to conceptualize and execute a social media campaign. Cadets also attended live-firing, adventure camps such as Camp FORGE, and Camp STEEL, and leadership training camps such as the Senior Specialist Leaders Course (SSLC) to prepare top student leaders in the CCA to be resilient leaders. NCC Air, supported by the RSAF, provides aerospace-related experiences in the military setting. This includes Flight Experience Programs on RSAF's C-130 and Fokker 50, and learning journeys to the air bases in Singapore. In addition, our Air Simulation Program, Aeromodelling courses, and Drone Swarming Program helped raise our cadet’s knowledge to the cutting edge.
