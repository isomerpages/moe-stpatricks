<h4><strong>Profile</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>"To lead with Resilience, Integrity, Service, Excellence, to RISE above"</strong></h5>
<p>As we transition into a post-covid year, the NPCC cadets demonstrated
unwavering resilience and adaptability. They not only navigated these challenges
but also thrived in an environment that prioritized safety while maintaining
a deep sense of engagement. Our cadets have much to be proud of. Some of
their proud accomplishments include spreading awareness of crime and cybercrime
prevention to the neighbourhood community, while our Cadet Leaders continued
to effectively utilize virtual platforms to teach junior members essential
drills and design comprehensive campcraft lesson packages. These dedicated
efforts translated into exceptional growth for our cadets. Proficiency
in various skills was attained, and numerous promotions were earned. This
collective commitment culminated in us achieving the prestigious Gold Award
for Unit Overall Proficiency in 2022. As we look ahead to the coming year,
our cadets are eager to take on even more activities and competitions.
This includes participating in Dragonboat for enrichment and the highly
competitive Inter-Unit eCSI Competition. It is also noteworthy that our
newly appointed Cadet Leaders have stepped up with enthusiasm and innovation,
all in the spirit of creating richer experiences for the unit, and we anticipate
even greater achievements in the future. At the National Police Cadet Corps,
we believe in instilling values of resilience, integrity, service, and
excellence in our cadets. We aim to prepare them to rise above challenges
and lead with honour. Together, we embrace these principles to not only
excel in our endeavors but also contribute to our school community and
society as a whole.</p>
