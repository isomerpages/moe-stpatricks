<h4><strong>Profile</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>"Pajigwad: Stick to it!"</strong></h5>
<p>Pajigwad Scout Troop has a rich history in St. Patrick’s School. Our Scouting
programme is focused on the Scout Method of learning by doing. Upon joining
the troop, Scouts are taught the Scout Law and Scout Promise, and are reminded
to live out the values in the Law and Promise throughout their journey
as a Scout. Scouts are placed in patrols, where senior scouts mentor and
guide their juniors on the Scout Method. Senior scouts belong to a Patrol
Leaders’ Council (PLC), where they develop leadership skills and influence
their peers. Scouts are engaged in a variety of activities – camping, campfires,
orienteering, outdoor cooking and pioneering, to develop their fullest
potential. The Scout Progress and Proficiency Badge scheme also enable
Scouts to discover and develop their interests and skills. The highest
level of achievement for a Scout to work towards is the Chief Commissioner’s
Award. Pajigwad Scout Troop has achieved the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award
and Chief Commissioner's Award. The journey in Pajigwad Scouts is meaningful
and memorable.</p>
