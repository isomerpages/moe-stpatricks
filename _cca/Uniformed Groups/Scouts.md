##### **"Pajigwad: Stick to it!"**

Pajigwad Scout Troop has a rich history in St. Patrick’s School. Our Scouting programme is focused on the Scout Method of learning by doing. Upon joining the troop, Scouts are taught the Scout Law and Scout Promise, and are reminded to live out the values in the Law and Promise throughout their journey as a Scout. Scouts are placed in patrols, where senior scouts mentor and guide their juniors on the Scout Method. Senior scouts belong to a Patrol Leaders’ Council (PLC), where they develop leadership skills and influence their peers. Scouts are engaged in a variety of activities – camping, campfires, orienteering, outdoor cooking and pioneering, to develop their fullest potential. The Scout Progress and Proficiency Badge scheme also enable Scouts to discover and develop their interests and skills. The highest level of achievement for a Scout to work towards is the Chief Commissioner’s Award. Pajigwad Scout Troop has achieved the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award and Chief Commissioner's Award. The journey in Pajigwad Scouts is meaningful and memorable.
