**"Pajigwad: Stick to it!"**

St. Patrick’s School Pajigwad Scouts Troop has attained the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award for more than 10 consecutive years. 

Our Scouts continue to exemplify excellence in their weekly training and at Scout HQ events. Weekly training sessions focus on honing core scouting skills and patrol bonding. Scouts continue to participate in HQ and area competitions and have clinched several awards.

Key experiences include the annual Troop Camp and Founder’s Day commemoration when patrols come together to develop and showcase their Scouting skills and develop camaraderie. Scouts also participate in the annual Job Week and community service projects. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Scouts contributed to the school as safe distancing ambassadors. Through these experiences. Scouts learn the value of teamwork, valour and excellence. Throughout all our activities we hold true to the Scout Promise:

On my Honour I promise that I will do my best

To do my duty to God and the Republic of Singapore

To help other people and

To keep the Scout Law
