#### **Profile**

##### **"The ball is in your court, give your best shot!"**

St. Patrickâ€™s tennis team has been training hard for the National School Games (NSG) despite the 2-year hiatus during the pandemic. Our players have maintained a deep commitment to sharpening their skills on the court and maintaining their fitness levels off it. Training hard and dutifully attending every coaching session even during the school holidays, the tennis team has shown remarkable commitment to the game.

The B division school team fought valiantly to emerge amongst the top 8 schools in Singapore. With their thirst for success, the C division team too will continue to do their best to bring glory to the school in their upcoming NSG.
