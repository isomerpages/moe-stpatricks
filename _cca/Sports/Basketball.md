<h5><strong>"One Team, One Basketball.<br>Team of Five, Heart of One."</strong></h5>
<p>The St. Patrick’s School Basketball Team is driven by discipline and focus
on and off the court. Preparation is the cornerstone of success, and is
at the heart of what the team does. Despite the challenges brought about
by the pandemic, the C and B Division team members continued to hone their
basic skills in preparation of any eventuality.</p>
<p>Their preparedness resulted in the best showing since the founding of
the Basketball Team, leveling with the top team in their grouping at the
National School Games 2022.</p>
<p>“A little progress each day adds up to big results”. The Basketball Team
holds firm to the knowledge that we will continue to strive: through resilience
we will continue to achieve excellence!</p>
