#### **Title**

##### **"One Team, One Basketball.<br>Team of Five, Heart of One."**

The St. Patrick’s School Basketball Team is driven by discipline and focus on and off the court. Preparation is the cornerstone of success, and is at the heart of what the team does. Despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, the C and B Division team members continued to hone their basic skills in preparation of any eventuality.

Their preparedness resulted in the best showing since the founding of the Basketball Team, leveling with the top team in their grouping at the National School Games 2022.

 “A little progress each day adds up to big results”. The Basketball Team holds firm to the knowledge that we will continue to strive: through resilience we will continue to achieve excellence!
