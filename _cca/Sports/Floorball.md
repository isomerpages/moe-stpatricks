## Floorball

#### <center>We never lose. We either win or learn. You do not need to be great to start, but you need to start to be great.
	
Floorball is an exciting new CCA in St. Patrick’s School! Bringing together players from diverse backgrounds and levels of experience, our team is united in the belief that playing with passion leads to limitless possibilities. 

With training sessions that focus on skills acquisition our team members have shown time and again that self-discipline is the key to perfecting their game. Working seamlessly as one, our pioneer batch of Floorball team players are keen to prove their mettle on the court.  

United as one in the face of adversity; the future is Floorball!
