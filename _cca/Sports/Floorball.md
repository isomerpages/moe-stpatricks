Floorball is an exciting new CCA in St. Patrickâ€™s School! Bringing together players from diverse backgrounds and levels of experience, our team is united in the belief that playing with passion leads to limitless possibilities.&nbsp;

With training sessions that focus on skills acquisition our team members have shown time and again that self-discipline is the key to perfecting their game. Working seamlessly as one, our pioneer batch of Floorball team players are keen to prove their mettle on the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;

United as one in the face of adversity; the future is Floorball!
