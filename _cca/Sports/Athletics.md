#### **Profile**

##### **"Track to Success!"**

Despite a two year hiatus due to the pandemic, athletes in both B and C Division showed their grit and determination to win in the Nationals Track and Field Competition this year.

Our athletes consistently pushed the limits, putting in hours under the heat to achieve excellence for the school. Their efforts were rewarded when they qualified for the Finals for a host of individual events such as 100m, 200m, and the 400m run. Both divisions also qualified for the Finals which saw our athletes put up a valiant effort in the 4 x 100 m and 4 x 400 m relay events. The C Division team clinched a respectable 7th position for the 400m, as well as a remarkable 2nd position for the 100m and 200m events. The B Division also performed admirably, securing 4th position for the High Jump event.

Our team is thankful for the experienced coaching by Coach Hamkah Afik and Coach Tang Ngai Kin who continue to instill the values of perseverance and belief in our athletes and led us to victory this year. May we continue to benefit from their guidance in the years to come!
