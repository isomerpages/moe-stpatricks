For the past 5 years, the SPS Football CCA has ranked within the top 4 positions for both B and C Divisions. Capitalizing on tactical adaptability and resilience, the teamâ€™s drive for success on the field is indisputable.

SPS Football CCA also continues to explore ways to extend a helping hand to the community. In the pipeline are VIA projects such as training sessions for disadvantaged youths to pick up footballing tricks and tips from our student athletes. This will go far in helping to inculcate a heart for the disadvantaged individuals in our society.

With a strong team spirit, SPS Football CCA school team will continue to strive for and achieve excellence, as one!
