##### **"Determined. Driven to Succeed.<br>Cricket is a battle, a service, a sport as well as a form of Art."**

The St. Patrick’s cricket team embodies the values of teamwork, respect, self-discipline, valour and excellence. Though a team sport, members of the Cricket Team constantly STRIVE to develop their individual skills during training sessions.

Through training routines in batting, bowling and fielding, the team works as one to perfect the way the game is played. Driven by a strong desire to dominate in the National School Games our players fought valiantly on the field. Victory was elusive, and our B Division players delivered the performance of their lifetime in the semi-final match. After an awe-inspiring display of grit and sportsmanship, our team marched proudly into the Semi-finals and Finals of the B Division Cricket tournament.

Onward and through, to success!
