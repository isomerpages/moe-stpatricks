##### **"Squash. Against all odds!"**

Tenacity, hard work and talent. All key ingredients in the recipe for success by the SPS Squash team which attained a commendable 4th placing in the 2022 B-Division National School Games (NSG).

The team leveraged on each other’s strengths through every serve and volley, culminating in a common goal of achieving that final kill shot out on the court. Weekly trainings provide players the opportunity to hone their skills with great precision whilst the collective dedication of both the coach and teachers have been crucial in developing values such as resilience and good sportsmanship amongst the team members.

SPS Squash provides a range of leadership opportunities for the development and holistic growth of the players. By mentoring younger players, senior players validate their leadership skills as well as develop their self-confidence.

Playing every match with poise, pride and positive sportsmanship, the team has indeed brought honor to our school at this year’s NSG!
