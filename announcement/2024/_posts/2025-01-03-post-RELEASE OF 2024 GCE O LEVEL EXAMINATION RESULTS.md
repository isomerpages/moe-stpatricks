<h1><strong>RELEASE OF 2024 GCE O-LEVEL EXAMINATION RESULTS&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>Dear Parents/ Guardians,</p>
<p>The results of the 2024 GCE O-Level examination will be released on Friday,
10 January 2025, from 2.30 pm onwards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We encourage all students to report to the School Hall by 2.00 pm on Friday. <strong><u>Do note that students are not required to wear the school uniform. They are allowed to report to school dressed appropriately in their home clothes.</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>If you are accompanying your child/ ward, do note that there is limited parking within the school compound. The gate beside Lasalle House will be opened to allow easy access to Marine Terrace MRT and the nearby HDB carparks at Marine Terrace.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students who are unwell are advised to seek medical attention and not
return to school to collect their results. Students who are unable to collect
their results in person can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy
of their results on their behalf from the school. Proxies are required
to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting
the results. A copy of the proxy form can be found at this link – <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sps-proxy-form" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/sps-proxy-form</a>.
